# Difference between Modules and packages

In Python, both modules and packages are used to organize and structure code. They allow you to break down large programs into smaller, more manageable components, making your code easier to maintain, understand, and reuse. However, there are distinct differences between modules and packages:

Module:

Definition: A module is a single file that contains Python code and definitions, such as functions, classes, and variables.
Purpose: Modules are used to group related functionality together, making it easier to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.

Package:

Definition: A package is a collection of multiple Python modules organized in a directory hierarchy.
Purpose: Packages are used to further organize related modules into a single namespace, providing a hierarchical structure to the codebase.
